When adding a new consumer (most common case):                                                                                                                                                                                  
Read CLAUDE-WIKI-TEMPLATE.md, then document the new <ConsumerName> consumer                                                                                                                                                     
in the wiki following the established patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                 
That's it. The template already tells Claude where to look in the source code, what files to update (both business_logic.md and architecture.md), and what structure/phrases to use.

When bootstrapping a brand new project wiki from scratch:
Read CLAUDE-WIKI-TEMPLATE.md and create the full wiki structure for this project.
Explore the codebase first to understand the architecture, consumers, dependencies,
and infrastructure before writing any documentation.
